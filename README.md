# data-project1
Starter assignment for dealing with data course

To-Do List

1. Install [Anaconda on your machine](https://www.anaconda.com/download).  Make sure you get the python 3.7 version appropriate for your computer
2. Confirm that Anaconda is working by doing the sample visualization (we'll do this together in class).  There are several cells at the end that you should change and write comments in.
3. Save the file, commit the changes to your repository, then push the changes to the github repository to submit your assignment.  We will do this part together in class
